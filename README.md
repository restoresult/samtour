## TL;DR
If you use `pandas`, just get the data via:
```python
import pandas as pd 
df_men = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/TDF_Riders_History.csv")
df_women = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/TDFF_Riders_History.csv")

```
If you use `R` instead of `python`, you can run:
```R
library(readr)
df_men <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/TDF_Riders_History.csv")
df_women <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/TDFF_Riders_History.csv")
```

## Le Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift

As of 2023, the data for Le Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift is available on the official [tour website](https://www.letourfemmes.fr/en). This data is now included as well. To assure backward compatibility, the data for the men's and women's versions of Le Tour are stored in different files. 

## Data
Every cyclist of the Tour de France in a single CSV file, stored in the file `data/TDF_Riders_History.csv`.
There's also data on every stage in `data/TDF_Stages_History.csv`.

The women's tour data is stored in files with the prefix `TDFF` (Tour de France Femmes).

## How to run
In your shell, just run these commands:
```python
poetry install # to install the environment
poetry run python letourdataset/Downloader.py # get the data
```

## Disclaimer 
For issues with this data set, see the [Issues tab](https://github.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/issues). There are some entries that are incorrect. However, so far it seems that the mistake stems from wrong data on the letour.fr website. Looking back, I should have probably scraped another website.

## Legacy code
This code has been completely rewritten. The previous code, including the output, is in the [legacy repository](https://github.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSetLegacy). Especially `legacy/README.txt` should be read.
